    <strong>ðŸ‘¶ COPPA Compliance:</strong> CyberSecured AI is committed to protecting children's privacy in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We implement special safeguards for educational technology environments where children under 13 may use school-provided services.
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. COPPA Overview and Application</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 What is COPPA</h3>
    <p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of children under 13 years of age online. COPPA requires parental consent before collecting personal information from children and establishes specific requirements for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Notice and disclosure of information practices</li>
      <li>Parental consent for data collection and use</li>
      <li>Access rights for parents to review child information</li>
      <li>Safe harbor provisions for school-authorized services</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 CyberSecured AI and COPPA</h3>
    <p>CyberSecured AI serves educational institutions and may encounter student data through our cybersecurity services. Our COPPA compliance approach includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>School Authorization:</strong> Operating under COPPA's school consent exception</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Collection:</strong> Minimal collection of student information for cybersecurity purposes</li>
      <li><strong>No Marketing:</strong> No collection or use of student information for advertising or marketing</li>
      <li><strong>Enhanced Protection:</strong> Additional safeguards beyond COPPA requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 When COPPA Applies</h3>
